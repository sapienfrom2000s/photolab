Admin will only have a single record; sort of like owner. I am not 
renaming it as it's not that important right now. If in confusion,
you can rename Admin as Owner in your head.

Read Photo and Card controller as PhotoProducts and CardProducts contro
ller.Same goes for Model as well. Both of these should be renamed
